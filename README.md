# Heavy Rotation

#### Created by Alma Frankenstein for Epicodus, 2020

## Description
Welcome! Heavy Rotation is a blog where people can post the songs they've been listening to on repeat lately, and see what their friends are listening to.

To use the site in your browser, visit [https://heavy-rotation.herokuapp.com/](https://heavy-rotation.herokuapp.com/)

Special thanks to Miguel Grinberg for his excellent book 'Flask Web Development' (O'Reilly, 2018) and many online tutorials.

## Specs
Users can:
* Post which songs they have on heavy rotation
* Click a link to a posted song (if one has been added) and have that link open in a new browser tab
* Follow other users and see their posts
* Add 'about me' information to their profile

Other features include:
* Pagination
* Picture uploads
* User authentication

## Setup

To run on your localhost, clone this repo using:

```git clone https://github.com/alma-frankenstein/heavy_proto.git heavyRotation```

cd to the heavyRotation directory.

Install Python3, if you haven't already

Create a virtual environment for the project:
* Run ```python3 -m venv venv```
* Activate it with ```source venv/bin/activate```

Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install all dependencies

Create a migration repository for a database: ```flask db init```

Add a subdirectory in the 'static' folder called 'avatars' (this folder is in .gitignore).

Still with the virtual environment activated, run ```flask run```, then open the browser window indicated
(this will probably be http://127.0.0.1:5000/). You should see the welcome page.

To add changes to the database:
* Add the change to models.py
* Run ```flask db migrate``` to generate a migration script
* Then ```flask db upgrade``` to add the changes to the database

To run the test suite:
* Make sure the virtual environment is activated (see above), then run ```python tests.py```

#### Examining the Database: Some Basics
* In the terminal with the virtrual environment activated, run ```flask shell```
* See all users:

  `>>>` users = User.query.all() https://github.com/alma-frankenstein/heavy_proto
  
  `>>>` users

* Get user by ID:

  `>>>` userById = User.query.get([id])

* See songs ordered by most recently added:
  
  `>>>` Song.query.order_by(timestamp.desc()).all()

* If you have been added songs to test the app and would like to clear them all (same for users):
  
  `>>>` songs = Song.query.all()
  
  `>>>` for s in songs:

  ...     db.session.delete(s)

  ... 

  `>>>` db.session.commit()

  * In order for these changes to show, exit then restart the shell:

  `>>>` exit()
